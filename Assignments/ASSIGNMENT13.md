# What are different types for testing??

- Unit tests

- Integration tests

- Functional tests

- End to end tests

# What is `Enzyme`?

- `Enzyme` is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

# Enzyme vs React Testing Library

- The Enzyme allows you to access the internal workings of your components. You can read and set the state, and you can mock children to make tests run faster. On the other hand, react-testing-library doesn't give you any access to the implementation details.

- Both Jest and Enzyme are meant to test the react applications. Jest can be used with any other Javascript framework, but Enzyme is meant to run on react only. Jest can be used without Enzyme, and snapshots can be created and tested perfectly fine. But the Enzyme adds additional functionality to it.

# What is `Jest` and why do we use it?

- `Jest` is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.
